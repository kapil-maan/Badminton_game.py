* **Classic 2D Badminton Gameplay:** Enjoy intuitive and engaging badminton mechanics.
* **Dynamic Badminton Court:** Clearly rendered court with boundary lines and a central net.
* **Responsive Human Player Control:**
    * Move left and right using Arrow Keys.
    * Use the Up Arrow Key to jump or prepare for a high shot.
    * Swing your racket with the Spacebar.
* **Challenging AI Opponent:**
    * Intelligently tracks the shuttlecock's movement.
    * Strategically positions itself to return shots.
    * Varies its returns, providing a dynamic challenge.
    * Includes a reaction time to make gameplay fair and engaging.
* **Realistic Shuttlecock Physics (Simplified):**
    * Shuttlecock movement influenced by gravity.
    * Hits propel the shuttlecock in a realistic arc, considering hit angle.
    * Basic air resistance for natural deceleration.
* **Accurate Collision Detection:**
    * Player Racket vs. Shuttlecock.
    * Shuttlecock vs. Net (shuttlecock can hit the net tape and fall).
    * Shuttlecock vs. Court Boundaries (for in/out calls).
* **Serving Mechanic:** Player who won the last point serves (can be configured). Serve must cross the net.
* **Comprehensive Scoring System:** Points awarded for shots landing in the opponent's court, or when the opponent hits the shuttlecock into the net or out of bounds.
* **Clear Game State Management:**
    * Smooth transitions between serving, playing, point scored, and game over states.
    * On-screen display of the current score.
* **Reset Option:** Restart the game quickly by pressing the 'R' key after a match concludes.
* **Basic Sound Effects (Optional):** Includes placeholders or simple sounds for shuttlecock hits, bounces, and scoring to enhance immersion.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Pygame (`pip install pygame`)

## Installation

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/BadmintonPy.git
    ```
    (Replace `[YourGitHubUsername]` with your actual GitHub username and `BadmintonPy` with your repository name if different)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd BadmintonPy
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    (It's good practice to use a virtual environment)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If `requirements.txt` only contains Pygame, you can also just run `pip install pygame`.*

4.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    (Or `python badminton_game.py` if you named it differently)

## How to Play

### Objective
The goal is to score more points than the AI opponent by successfully hitting the shuttlecock over the net so it lands within the opponent's court boundaries.

### Controls

* **Left Arrow Key:** Move player left.
* **Right Arrow Key:** Move player right.
* **Up Arrow Key:** Player jumps (can be used to reach higher shots or as part of a swing preparation).
* **Spacebar:** Swing racket to hit the shuttlecock. Timing and position are crucial!
* **R Key:** Restart the game after a match is over (win or lose).
* **Escape Key:** Quit the game.

### Game Rules

1.  **Serving:**
    * The game starts with a serve. Typically, the player who won the previous point serves.
    * The server must hit the shuttlecock over the net into the opponent's service area (simplified for this game).
2.  **Rallying:**
    * Players alternate hitting the shuttlecock over the net.
    * A shot is good if it passes over the net and lands within the opponent's court boundaries.
3.  **Scoring a Point:** A player scores a point when:
    * Their opponent hits the shuttlecock into the net.
    * Their opponent hits the shuttlecock out of bounds.
    * The shuttlecock hit by the player lands within the opponent's court and is not returned.
    * Their opponent fails to hit the shuttlecock.
4.  **The Net:** The shuttlecock must travel over the net. If it hits the net and falls on the hitter's side or fails to go over, the point is awarded to the opponent.
5.  **Winning:** The first player to reach a predefined score (e.g., 5, 11, or 21 points, as set in the game code) wins the match. A "Player Wins!" or "Computer Wins!" message will be displayed.

## Development Notes

This Badminton game is developed entirely in Python using the **Pygame** library. The core game logic, including player controls, AI behavior, shuttlecock physics, collision detection, and game state management, is primarily contained within `main.py` (or `badminton_game.py`).

Key conceptual components within the code might include:
* `Player` class: Manages human player state, movement, and actions.
* `AIPlayer` class: Controls the computer opponent's logic and movements.
* `Shuttlecock` class: Handles the shuttlecock's physics, position, and interactions.
* `GameManager` (or similar structure): Oversees the game loop, rules, scoring, and state transitions.

### Amazon Q CLI Integration

A significant aspect of this project's development involved leveraging **Amazon Q CLI**. Natural language prompts were used to:
* **Generate foundational code:** Initial structures for the game window, player classes, and basic game loop.
* **Iterate on game mechanics:** Refine shuttlecock physics (e.g., "make the shuttlecock arc realistically after a hit"), AI behavior (e.g., "improve AI to anticipate shuttlecock landing spots"), and scoring logic.
* **Implement features:** Add functionalities like the serving mechanic, game reset options, and visual display elements.
This approach helped accelerate the prototyping and development process, allowing for rapid iteration on complex game features.

## Future Enhancements

* **Advanced AI Strategies:** Implement more sophisticated AI tactics (e.g., drop shots, smashes, defensive clears based on player position).
* **Player Sprites & Animations:** Replace simple shapes with animated player sprites for swings and movement.
* **Enhanced Sound Design:** Add more varied sound effects and background music.
* **Visual Customization:** Options for different court themes or character appearances.
* **Two Human Player Mode:** Allow two human players to compete against each other locally.
* **Difficulty Levels:** Introduce selectable difficulty settings for the AI opponent.

## Credits

* **Lead Developer:** [Your Name/Alias]
* **Game Concept:** Inspired by the classic sport of Badminton and various arcade sports games.
* **Development Assistance:** Foundational code structure and iterative refinement of game mechanics were significantly supported by prompts given to **Amazon Q CLI**.
* **Pygame Community:** For the excellent Pygame library and extensive documentation.

**Remember to:**

1.  Replace placeholders like `[YourGitHubUsername]`, `[Your Name/Alias]`, and the screenshot path with your actual information.
2.  Create a `requirements.txt` file. For a simple Pygame project, it might just contain:
    ```
    pygame>=2.0.0
    ```
3.  Consider adding a `LICENSE.md` file (the MIT License is a common and permissive choice for open-source projects).
4.  Actually take a cool screenshot or make a GIF of your game and put it in the `screenshots` folder!

This README should provide a solid foundation for your GitHub repository, making it inviting and informative for anyone who stumbles upon your brilliant badminton game!
