## 🛠️ Development Notes

This project is powered by **Pygame** and structured around key game entities:

* `Player` — Movement, control, and swing logic
* `AIPlayer` — Tracks and reacts to gameplay intelligently
* `Shuttlecock` — Physics, collisions, and trajectory
* `GameManager` — Main loop, state handling, and scorekeeping

---

## 🤖 Amazon Q CLI Integration

A key aspect of this project was rapid iteration with **Amazon Q CLI**:

* 🏗️ Scaffolded game window, classes, and loop via prompt-based generation
* 🔄 Refined logic like:

  * *“Make the AI smarter”*
  * *“Add realistic shuttle arc”*
  * *“Show the winner on screen”*
* ⏱️ Enabled quicker turnaround on core features and debugging

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* 🧠 Smarter AI: Add drop shots, smashes, lobs
* 🕹️ Two-Player Mode (local multiplayer)
* 🎨 Better sprites, animations, and visual polish
* 🎼 Enhanced sounds & background music
* 🧩 Game settings menu with difficulty levels
